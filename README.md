Basic JavaScript animation of an image on my blog. Made with plain JavaScript (no libraries), utilizing requestAnimationFrame API (thanks to [Paul Irish's blog](http://www.paulirish.com/2011/requestanimationframe-for-smart-animating/)), and sprite sheet made with [GIMP,](https://www.gimp.org/) (whose UI makes me want break things). The results are less than stellar, but I got the gist of sprite sheet animation & it has made me very thankful for gifs.
